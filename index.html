        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Aleah White, I am 18 years old and just graduated High School in 2023. I am super family-oriented and love spending time either alone, or cooking, talking, playing games with family and friends. I have been interested in tech for about a year now but never knew exactly where I fit or where I wanted to be apart of. More and more I looked for jobs or parts of tech that spark my interest. I have been super interested in web development, so I looked into shorter courses I could take to further my knowlegde. This course has definitely been a little challenging or rigorous, but has been so much fun and super informational. This is a website that I am building as a demo of a professional portfolio for finding jobs and showing the skills that I have or will have learned. Below you will find a work section that has 5 different kinds of projects that I will have worked on in the future. Below that you will find my contact information including my phone number, email, and GitHub. Where you can look at the other projects I have done, reach out to me about work/if you have any questions. Thank you for taking the time to read about me and check out my portfolio!!  </p>
